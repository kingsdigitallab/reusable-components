Eleventy SSG for devs
=====================

Documentation about how KDL sites are developed using a Static Site Generator called
`11ty <https://www.11ty.dev/>`__.

Installing 11ty
---------------

You need `node.js v16+ & npm installed on your
machine <https://nodejs.dev/download/>`__.

To install 11ty, run the following command from within alice-thornton
folder.

``npm ci``

Generating the site
-------------------

To generate the whole static site into the \_site folder.

``npm run rebuild``

To run it as a development server:

``npm run serve``

Then go to `localhost:8000 <localhost:8000>`__. Each time you modify a
source file, 11ty will automatically rebuild the site and refresh it in
your browser. .

Misc
----

**Add unclassified tip here first so we don't forget about them, we can relocate them later.**

**frontend** folder contains all the data and code to generate your site:

* _includes: contains liquid templates and fragments
   * frontend/_includes/js: contains **serve-side** javascript (As opposed to client-side, see below)
* assets: contains all the **client-side** resources loaded by your web pages (css, js, fonts, node_modules, img); the folder is copied as-is to the site.
* _site: where the site is built by 11ty (this folder is disposable)
* _data: global metadata, collections and computed fields
   * layout.json: points to the default layout for any page (see _includes folder)
   * eleventyComputed.js: computed fields available to every page/layout and fragment
   * metadata.json: golbal settings for your site
* _build: to deploy using docker or other methods than npm (currently unused)
